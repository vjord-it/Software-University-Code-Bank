All required libraries are listed in the package.json file.

To rebuild the project and test it, open it inside WebStorm and in the terminal enter:

npm install

This step will take a while (5-10 minutes, depending on the performance of your computer).

After installing libraries, again in the terminal enter:

npm start

This will start a local server at port 3000 and automatically open the project in your default browser.
