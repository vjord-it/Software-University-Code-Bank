Compiled languages:

  The source code text written by programmers is translated and an
  executable file is made.  The executable file in turn is used for
  running (executing) the program.

Interpreted languages:

  The source code text used directly for running the program.  This is
  achieved by an installed program (interpreter) which executes the
  instructions.

Compiled vs Interpreter:

  Compiled programs are typically faster and require less memory,
  while interpreted programs are more convenient to write and run.
  Interpreted programs also require an interpreter to be installed
  before running the program.

Is C compiled or interpreted:

  C is compiled.
